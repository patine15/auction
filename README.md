# AdvancedAuction

A smart contract for an advanced auction system on Ethereum.

## üì¶ Variables

- **owner**: `address`  
  The address of the contract owner (auction creator).

- **endTime**: `uint256`  
  The timestamp when the auction ends.

- **finalized**: `bool`  
  Indicates whether the auction has been finalized.

- **commission**: `uint256`  
  The commission percentage (default: 2%).

- **highestBid**: `uint256`  
  The current highest bid in the auction.

- **highestBidder**: `address`  
  The address of the current highest bidder.

- **bids**: `Bid[]`  
  An array containing all bids (each with bidder address and amount).

- **userBidHistory**: `mapping(address => uint256[])`  
  Stores the bid history (amounts) for each user.

- **deposits**: `mapping(address => uint256)`  
  The total amount deposited by each user.

- **pendingRefunds**: `mapping(address => uint256)`  
  The amount available for partial refund for each user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Functions

- **constructor(uint256 _durationMinutes)**  
  Initializes the auction with a specified duration in minutes.

- **placeBid() external payable**  
  Allows users to place a bid. The bid must be at least 5% higher than the current highest bid. If the bid is placed within the last 10 minutes, the auction is extended by 10 minutes.

- **withdrawPartialRefund() external**  
  Allows users to withdraw the partial refund from their previous bids.

- **finalizeAuction() public onlyOwner auctionActive**  
  Finalizes the auction. Only the owner can call this function, and only after the auction has ended.

  Allows users to withdraw their deposit if they are not the winner. The winner can withdraw the remaining balance minus the commission.

- **withdrawFunds() external onlyOwner auctionFinalized**  
  Allows the owner to withdraw the commission and the winning amount after the auction is finalized.

- **getWinner() public view returns (address, uint256)**  
  Returns the address of the highest bidder and the highest bid.

- **getBids() public view returns (Bid[] memory)**  
  Returns the list of all bids.

- **getUserBidHistory(address user) public view returns (uint256[] memory)**  
  Returns the bid history of a specific user.

- **getTimeLeft() public view returns (uint256)**  
  Returns the remaining time for the auction.

## üì¢ Events

- **NewBid(address indexed bidder, uint256 amount, uint256 timeLeft)**  
  Emitted when a new bid is placed.

- **AuctionFinalized(address winner, uint256 amount)**  
  Emitted when the auction is finalized.
